Scene Designer – Engineering & Review Instructions (Short, for Copilot Space)

1. Use ES module syntax for all imports and exports.
   - No window.*, no globals, no CDN scripts.
   - Exception: Console.Re remote logging uses connector.js CDN script (remove when ESM available).

2. Every import must be satisfied by a real export.
   - Update imports/exports as needed.

3. File delivery and review:
   - Deliver complete files only, one at a time.
   - List all files up front, number them.
   - Wait for explicit confirmation ("next", "ready") between files.
   - Update src/modules.index.md when adding/removing/renaming modules.

4. File size:
   - No file over ~500 lines.
   - Split large files into logical modules (core, UI, helpers, etc).
   - Each part ≤500 lines if possible.
   - Update imports/exports and modules.index.md after splitting.

5. Logging:
   - Use log() from log.js with levels: ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG.
   - No console.log except inside logger.

6. Each module/file must start with a comment summarizing purpose, exports, dependencies.

7. State management:
   - Use exported functions and store object from state.js (Zustand style).
   - No AppState singletons.

8. Separation of concerns:
   - UI emits intents/actions only.
   - All business logic for scene actions (add, delete, duplicate, lock, unlock, etc) is in actions.js.
   - No direct state mutation from UI.

9. Manifest:
   - Update src/modules.index.md for all module changes.

10. Auto-generated files:
    - src/exports.index.json is auto-generated; do not edit by hand.
