# Scene Designer – Engineering & Review Instructions

These instructions are binding for all development, code review, and delivery in the Scene Designer project.

---

## 1. ES Module Enforcement

- All code must use ES module syntax for imports and exports.
- No use of window.*, global variables, or global libraries.
- External dependencies (e.g., Konva, Pickr, Golden Layout) must be imported as ES modules.

### 1A. Transitional Exception: Remote Logging via Console.Re

- Remote log streaming must use the official Console.Re connector script:
  ```html
  <script src="//console.re/connector.js" data-channel="scene-designer"></script>
  ```
- This ensures compatibility with the current Console.Re dashboard and captures early errors.
- The legacy npm UMD CDN (`console-remote-client`) is deprecated and MUST NOT be used except for backward compatibility with older builds.
- This exception is strictly for remote logging only.
- All other dependencies and code must remain ES module–only and avoid global/window usage.
- Remove this exception as soon as Console.Re provides a proper ES module export.

---

## 2. Import/Export Consistency

- Every import must be satisfied by a real export in the source file.
- Update the source or import as needed to ensure consistency.
- Enforce for all code changes and file deliveries.

---

## 3. File Delivery and Review Workflow

- All code delivery, review, and requests operate on complete files only (never snippets).
- File-by-file delivery workflow:
  1. List all files to be delivered up front, with explicit numbering (e.g., 1. fileA.js, 2. fileB.js, ...).
  2. Deliver each file, one at a time, in the order listed.
  3. After each file, state the name and number of the next file to expect (e.g., "Next file: 2. sidebar.js").
  4. Wait for explicit confirmation ("next", "ready", etc.) before delivering the next file.
  5. Keep a running list of remaining files/numbers in each reply until all are delivered.
  6. After all files, explicitly confirm completion (e.g., "All files delivered. Refactor complete.").
- If a module is added, removed, or renamed, update `src/modules.index.md`.

---

## 4. File Size Policy and Splitting

- No single file should exceed ~500 lines.
- If a file does, split into logical ES module parts (e.g., `settings-core.js`, `settings-ui.js`, or `settings.part1.js`, `settings.part2.js`).
- Each part should be ≤500 lines if possible.
- When splitting:
  - Prefer logical separation (core, UI, data, helpers, etc).
  - Each part must begin with a summary comment.
  - Update all imports/exports to use new modules.
  - Update `src/modules.index.md` to list all new files.
  - Document the split in the PR/commit summary.
- This policy is mandatory for all new code and for any refactoring of large files.

---

## 5. Logging and Documentation

- Use the shared logger (`log()`) from `log.js` with proper log levels and tags.
  - `ERROR`, `WARN`, `INFO`, `DEBUG`, `TRACE` (TRACE is very verbose; rarely used).
- Never use `console.log` directly except inside the logger implementation.
- Every module/file must begin with a comment summarizing purpose, exports, and dependencies.
- All cross-module communication must use ES module imports/exports.

---

## 6. Example (Good/Bad)

```js
// Good
import Konva from "konva";
import { buildSidebarPanel } from "./sidebar.js";

// Bad
const stage = new window.Konva.Stage(...);   // ❌ Not allowed
window.Pickr.create(...);                    // ❌ Not allowed
import { foo } from "./notExportedHere.js";  // ❌ Not allowed if not exported
```

---

## 7. State Management (Zustand-style, 2025 Update)

- All state flows through exported functions and the store object in `state.js`.
  - Use `getState()` to access the current state object.
  - Use mutators like `setShapes`, `addShape`, `removeShape`, etc.
  - Subscribe to state changes via `sceneDesignerStore.subscribe(fn)`.
  - Do not import a singleton `AppState` object.

---

## 8. Action/Intent-Based Separation of Concerns

- UI components emit "intents" or "actions" to dedicated handler modules.
  - Toolbar, keyboard shortcuts, and other panels DO NOT contain business logic for deletion, duplication, locking, etc.
  - All business logic for scene actions (delete, duplicate, lock, unlock, add shape, etc.) is centralized in `src/actions.js`.
  - Cross-module communication always uses ES module imports/exports.

---

## 9. Manifest and Documentation Updates

- All new modules (added/removed/renamed) must be reflected in `src/modules.index.md`.
- Update this file and the module manifest as needed to document architecture changes.

---

## 10. Auto-generated Files / Artifacts

- The file `src/exports.index.json` is auto-generated by tooling. Do not edit it by hand.
  - It may change when exports are added/removed/moved. Treat diffs as generated output during review.
  - If it appears out of sync locally, run the usual dev/build task to regenerate.
  - PRs may include this file; reviewers should not request manual edits to it.

Notes:
- `src/modules.index.md` remains curated manually and must be updated for module add/remove/rename events.
- The shapes module has been split: `src/shapes.js` is a facade re-exporting `src/shapes-core.js` and `src/shapes-point.js`. All imports should continue to target `./shapes.js`.
