# shapes.parts.index.md

This file defines the modular structure of the `shapes.js` application logic.  
**Each part file is listed in load/concat order.**  
Descriptions are updated as new logic is added or stubs are replaced.

- **Filename:** `shapes.part0.layout.js`
- **Responsibility:**  
  - Initializes Golden Layout with three panels (Sidebar, Canvas, Settings).
  - Registers panel components and placeholder logic.
  - Handles show/hide logic for Settings panel and exposes `myLayout` for debugging.
  - Integration: Requires `<div id="main-layout"></div>` in `index.html`.

- **Filename:** `shapes.part1.sidebar.js`
- **Responsibility:**

  - Current: Placeholder/hello world.
  - Future: Will show the table of annotation shapes and handle selection, lock, delete, etc.

### **PART 2: CanvasPanel Logic**  
*(Stub/hello world only; see 2A for real logic. Should be removed when 2A is active.)*
- **Filename:** `shapes.part2.canvas.js`
- **Responsibility:**  
  - Placeholder/hello world logic for the Canvas panel.
